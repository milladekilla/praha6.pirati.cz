  title: Building of new P+R parking lots
  desc: Building P+R parking lots on the outskirts of Prague within easy reach of public transport is a basic step in resolving of most of traffic problems of Prague 6. Visitors of Prague should be encouraged not to enter the wider centre by car, but park on the outskirts of Prague and use public transport instead. This reduces not only the traffic load but saves parking space too.
