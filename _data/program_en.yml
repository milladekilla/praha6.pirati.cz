  title: Building of 2 new P+R parking lots
  desc: Building P+R (Park & Ride) parking lots on the outskirts of Prague within easy reach of public transport is a basic step in resolving of lack of parking spaces in the city. Visitors to Prague should be encouraged not to enter the wider city centre by car, but park on the outskirts of Prague and use public transport instead. This not only reduces traffic-load but saves parking space too. In the coming election period, we will build two parking facilities to serve these purposes.
